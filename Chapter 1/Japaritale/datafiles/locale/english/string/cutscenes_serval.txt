"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.0"		"* T-That voice!"
"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.1"		"* Myamyamyamya~!"
"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.2"		"* Uh... Don't worry!&* I'm going to take you&  someplace!"
"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.3"		"* Alright, there!"

"cutscene.serval.greet.0"			"* Oh dear, I'm glad you're&  awake!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.1"			"* You made me really&  worried the first&  time I saw you!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.2"			"* Seeing you severely&  hurt by that little&  creature, left numb&  for hours..."
"cutscene.serval.greet.3"			"* At this point, I hope&  you're feeling recovered,&  honestly."
"cutscene.serval.greet.4"			"* Ah, it just feels like&  a miracle knowing&  you're alright!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.5"			"* But the real question&  is, do you know what&  type of species you are?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.6"			"* It's just I haven't&  seen a \"FRIEND\" like&  you, that's all!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.7"			"* Well that's weird.{w}&* A FRIEND who doesn't&  know their species?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.8"			"* Tell you what! JAPARI&  LIBRARY exists and I'm&  going to guide you to&  the gate."
"cutscene.serval.greet.9"			"* And... about your&  name, also?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.10"			"* Kaban-chan!{w}&* Does it sound good?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.11"			"* I named it after the&  bag you were carrying."
"cutscene.serval.greet.12"			"* That could be a clue...&  of your species,&  perhaps?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.13"			"* Why are we waiting here?&  Let's go!"

"cutscene.serval.new_friend.0"			"* Look at that!"
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.1"			"* Over that spot is&  Zebra-chan, a FRIEND&  like everyone here."
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.2"			"* Since she's a bit&  shy, I’d advise you&  not to frighten her."
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.3"			"* Don’t worry, none&  of the FRIENDS are&  harmful around here!"
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.4"			"* Why don't you have&  a little conversation&  with her?"
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.5"			"* I mean, I'm confident&  she'll loosen her&  shyness towards you!"

"cutscene.serval.post_convo.0"			"* You had quite a decent&  conversation there!"
"cutscene.serval.post_convo.1"			"* Thinking about how I had&  to get you to the&  library..."
"cutscene.serval.post_convo.2"			"* I think it'd better to&  move on to our mission."
"cutscene.serval.post_convo.3"			"* So, yeah!&* Let's go!"

"cutscene.serval.mountain.0"			"* A nice perspective from&  here, don't you think?"
"cutscene.serval.mountain.1"			"* I've heard this mountain&  would produce \"SANDSTAR\"&  each decade."
"cutscene.serval.mountain.2"			"* It's a pretty weird fact,&  I'd say."
"cutscene.serval.mountain.3"			"* You could happen to be&  born from there...&  perhaps?"
"cutscene.serval.mountain.4"			"* I'm... beginning to&  worry about the&  CELLIENS."

"cutscene.savannah.lake.0"			"* The water looks so delightful I&  cannot tolerate taking a sip."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.1"			"* Threathening the safety of&  my property, I see?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.2"			"* You know what happens to&  beings like you?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.3"			"* They experience death."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.4"			"* Hippo! &* Stop."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.5"			"* She's a FRIEND, like us."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.6"			"* Ooh!{w}&* A companion of yours, I see!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.7"			"* ..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.8"			"* I'm sorry, was I too&  harsh to both of you?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.9"			"* Not really, but it is&  honestly annoying."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.10"			"* Glad to hear that."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.11"			"* Anyways, I was going&  to ask you why you&  put KABAN in such fear."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.12"			"* Those little creatures&  were bothering me off, thus&  I wasn't morally fine."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.13"			"* Though look out for the&  huge CELLIEN halting&  the gate."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.14"			"* You two aren't strong&  enough to beat it anyway!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.15"			"* Then why not do it&  yourself?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.16"			"* I've got more important&  things to do..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.17"			"* ..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.18"			"* Anyways, we've got&  things to do as well!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.19"			"* Don't you think your&  little \"companion\" needs&  to take cover?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.20"			"* Hippo, please."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.21"			"* It seems you've forgotten&  the rules of Japari Park&  as well!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.22"			"*{voice -1} ............"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.23"			"* S-she is more capable&  than you think!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.24"			"* Well then.{w}&* We'll see what this&  companion has got!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.25"			"* So, are you able to swim?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.26"			"* No?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.27"			"* Well, how about running&  fast?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.28"			"* Unfortunate..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.29"			"* What about flying?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.30"			"* She's not someone who's&  trustworthy by any means,&  Serval."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.31"			"* You wouldn't want to leave&  a child like this alone&  in a conflict, would you?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.32"			"* And thus, why don't I teach&  you two how to sprint?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.33"			"* Teaching!? &* I don't think--"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.34"			"* Laziness won't work in a&  situation like this, Serval.{w}&* It is important."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.35"			"* (Here we go again...)"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.36"			"* Well then!&* Get ready for a minute-long&  lesson!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.37"			"* I eagerly listened to Hippo's&  words and learned something&  new as a result."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.38"			"* This technique will surely&  boost my skills in a fight."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.39"			"* I've mastered the \"{color `yellow`}RUNNING{color `white`}\" &  technique!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.40"			"* This...{w} did NOT go well."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.41"			"* I mean, at least Kaban&  knows something valuable&  now."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.42"			"* You don't have to be biased&  for that little advice, &  you know."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.43"			"* Uh,{w} let's just go."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.44"			"Press [X] or [SHIFT] to sprint!"

"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.0"	"* What do you think&  you're doing?!"
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.1"	"* Could you please be&  aware there is a threat&  in front of us?"
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.2"	"* Look, just listen to&  Hippo-chan."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.3"	"* I'm aware she's annoying,&  but this is critical."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.4"	"* She isn't actually wrong&  or anything, she's&  just..."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.5"	"* She's just experienced&  about battling!"
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.6"	"* But this is what&  worries me the most."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.7"	"* To this day, I still&  remember the folk living&  here like yesterday..."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.8"	"* But now they need my&  help."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.9"	"* I've also got to stop&  being clumsy as well."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.10"	"* You see, Kaban. &* It's too dangerous&  for you."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.11"	"* So go find the nicest&  hiding place, OK?"
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.12"	"* And leave the job to me."

"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.confirm.0"	"* I know you'd&  understand me, KABAN."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.confirm.1"	"* Now quick!{w}&* Go back to the&  lake!"

"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.decline.0"	"* Have you already&  forgotten the dangers&  awaiting you?"
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.decline.1"	"* I'm being pretty&  serious, KABAN, and I&  don't want you to die."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.decline.2"	"* Please..."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.decline.3"	"* .........{w}&* ............"
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.decline.4"	"* Okay, KABAN.{w}&* I'll let you in to&  the fight for once."
"cutscene.savannah.bridge.before_fight.decline.5"	"* Maybe... one can't&  do but two can&  do better!"

"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.0"	"* Hey, thanks for the&  huge help while ago."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.1"	"* It might've been&  impossible without you."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.2"	"* So, this is the time&  we seperate our ways,&  right?"
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.3"	"* I'm going to miss you&  so much."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.4"	"* Considering the fact&  we've spent so much&  time together..."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.5"	"* To tell the truth, I'm&  craving to come&  with you, but I can't."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.6"	"* But it's all alright!{w}&* There is nothing for&  me to worry about!"
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.7"	"* Please do me a favor,&  will you?"
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.8"	"* Do NOT lose the hat&  no matter what happens."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.9"	"* It's a reminant from&  someone very important&  in this world."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.10"	"* Even if you're in&  trouble, this hat will&  save you from dangers."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.11"	"* {color `red`}ONLY THE HAT{color `white`} protects&  you."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.12"	"* Understood?"
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.13"	"* Now I just have to&  go."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.14"	"* I'm sure we can meet&  again sometime."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.15"	"* Eh...?{w}&* The owner of the hat?"
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.16"	"* It's from someone&  very important in this&  world."
"cutscene.savannah.post_battle.17"	"* Well, see you later!"
